Risk Assessment for Heat-Wave 
=======================
**Heat-wave definition**

Multiple methodologies can define the heat wave. But in general, the heat-wave is determined by the air temperature and the duration (days) thresholds. 

**Risk Assessment methodology**

This workflow consists of two parts: 1. Hazard and 2.Risk Assessment:

**1. Hazard assessment**
In Hazard assessment, we use 3 different methodologies ([Euroheat](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/tools/euroheat-online-heatwave-forecast), [Peseta IV](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peseta_IV), [Xclim](https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indicators.html) ) for the heat-wave estimation. The user can choose from the most suitable methods for his needs. These methodologies differ in the input data, temperature treshold, duration thresholds, computing algorithm, and results. So in the first step, the user will choose the methodology based on the pros and cons of each methodology. Each methodology works with the air temperature data for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) climate scenarios 4.5 (medium) and 8.5 (extreme) [[more about RCPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway)]. 

Results from hazard assessment give you information about the heat-wave occurrence in the reference period 1971-2000 and three projection periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100 represented in yearly and monthly (only Peseta IV) values.
