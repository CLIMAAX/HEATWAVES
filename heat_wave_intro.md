# Heat-wave workflow

Multiple methodologies can define the heat wave. But in general, the heat-wave is determined by the air temperature and the duration (days) thresholds. Thus the most frequent definition of a heat wave is the occurrence of at least multiple consecutive days with the maximum air (and minimum air temperature depending on the methodology) temperature over a certain threshold. 

The heat-wave focuses on the estimation of the heat wave events for the past, and for the future based on the Euro-Cordex climate scenarios. The user can see the difference between the heat-wave occurrence caused by the influence of climate change for medium and extreme scenarios of the representation concentration pathways (RCPs), for the selected area in Europe in the 12x12km spatial resolution. The results are provided for years and months and also provide information about the heat-wave duration (total number of days) of the heat-waves.

In addition, get information about the overheated parts in your selected area and the distribution of the vulnerable groups of the population in the 100x100m resolution. These informations are based on the measured data in your area. If you are more interested in the influence of the heat on the vegetation, you can also use the high-resolution (10x10m) vegetation characteristics data from remote sensing. This data gives you information about the current vegetation health.
